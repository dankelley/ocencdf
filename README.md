This package provides an interface from the internal representation used
by the `oce` package to the NetCDF file format.  It is in an early stage
of development, with work focused on CTD, ADCP and ADV data, to set up
coding patterns that can be used on other data.  The order of tackling
`oce` objects will be guided by the needs of the author's immediate
colleagues, and by convincing arguments made in the issues tab of the
project website.
