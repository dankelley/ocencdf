This package provides an interface from the internal representation used by the
oce package to the Netcdf file format.  It is in an early stage of development,
with work focussed on CTD and ADCP data, to set up coding patterns that can be
used on other data.  The order of tackling oce objects will be determined by
needs within the author's research circle, and also by convincing arguments
made in the issues tab of the project website.
