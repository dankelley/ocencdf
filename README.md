This package provides an interface from the internal representation used by the
oce package to the Netcdf file format.  It is in an early stage of development,
with work focussed on CTD, ADCP and ADV data, to set up coding patterns that can
be used on other data.  The order of tackling oce objects will be guided by the
needs of the author's immediate colleagues, and by convincing arguments made in
the issues tab of the project website.
